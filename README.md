# HomeShowRipOrganizer
A home ripped show (movie/series) video library organizer made for the 'Database Theory' course at Linnaeus University (converted from older version to work with Java>=9 modularity).

# The Application
The purpose is to show the ability to handle complex SQL statements. The idea of the application would be to organize the locations and information about the shows (movies or TV-series) that the users had bought and made a ripped version of; so that it will be easier to link every show personnel (actor/actress, director, or author) and their information to the shows (and shows' information) they participated in.

### Note:
Although making use of artificial primary keys makes designing and implementation easier, it was intended not to use them here to prepare and practice for any future situation where the use of artificial primary keys is not allowed (it is much easier to use them and the whole solution can be easily converted to use them).
